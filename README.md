# 1209 Kitbot 2026
This is the code for our modified kitbot this year.

## Current differences from the standard kitbot:
- It is built with swerve drive rather than differential (tank)

## Contributing
You cannot commit directly to the main branch. Instead, you must make a new branch and then create a pull request to merge with the main branch.

Additionally, to merge your pull request, your code must compile. This is managed by GitHub Actions which will test running the code before merging.
